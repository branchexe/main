1) More responsive links on top navigation bar
2) More about me stuff
3) About me links to that portion of the page or a whole seperate about me page
4) Fine tune Steve logo (better positioning)
5) Fix padding on when hovering over navigation bar elements (steve logo may hold the answer to this seeing as it does not move elements when being hovered over)
6) Special effects on words (especially about me)
7) more images
8) cosmetics of dark and light mode buttons, maybe add moon or sun icon, maybe animated icon could be done by trading buttons with image with href attatched (or integrate buttons)
9) Add the quiet fox logo or website credits page
